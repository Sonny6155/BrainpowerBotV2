Format required:

textScript|timing

Things to remember
1. "|" is the pipe character, not I or l.
2. Do NOT use "|" more than once per line. If it is required in the text, please use another character in it's place.
3. Make sure that there are no extra empty lines, before or after the text.
4. Do NOT edit the file while the bot is running. Just, don't.
